# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have required tools installed on your OS, for running the application, especially Android Studio, because the application is tested in that only.. Thankyou!

## Step 1: Create Directory and Start Metro

First, you need to create the directory by downloading or pulling all the files, then just "cd Project Folder" and then run with the command "npx react-native start"... this will start the metro server.. 

## Step 2: Starting the app, via Android only

As we have initialized the project for Android only, so for testing and running it in your platform (either it is Windows or Mac) use Android Studio and then run the android folder from the project directory.  

### For Android

After running metro, open "Android Studio" and open the "android" folder from the "RebootingRebelsFinal" Folder and then launch the application after 'gradle sync'


### Executing the Application

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see application running in your Android Emulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### About the App

This application is our project for Cross Development-II Course, and we have built the Firebase Integration Functionality, User Profile, etc according to the requirements..

Thankyou! We all team of four members who enjoy to code and helpful to the community by commiting :) :) :) :)
